# Blink Alert System

## Overview
The Blink Alert System is a Python application that detects blinks using a webcam and alerts the user when blinks are detected. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect facial landmarks and monitor blink patterns in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time blink detection using a webcam
- Audio or video alert when blinks are detected
- Adjustable threshold for blink detection
- Visual representation of blink frequency over time

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- moviepy
- FaceMeshModule (included in cvzone)
- PlotModule (included in cvzone)

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd BlinkAlertSystem

# Install the required dependencies
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
pip install moviepy
pip install mediapipe
pip install moviepy
pip install pygame
```

## Usage
- Upon running the script, the webcam will activate, and the blink detection process will begin.
- Adjust the blink detection threshold in the code according to your preferences.
- Ensure that the video file for the alert is present in the specified path or adjust the path accordingly.
